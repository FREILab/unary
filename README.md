# Unary

This software is, as of yet, a proof-of-concept for a digital tally sheet. It will be used to let users self-manage their beverage consumption at the Freilab in Freiburg.

## Setup

A short idea of how to set this up:

* Replace the secret key in `init.py`
* Run `bower install` and `npm install` in `client/` directory.
* Replace the font in the SCSS with a webfont you can actually deliver
* Set up the database and maybe use `dbedit.py` to add some content
* Add product/user gfx in `data/img`
